JAN SEVAK - Emergency Accident Response System

**Problem Statement:**

Road accidents claim thousands of lives every year due to delays in accident reporting, inefficient ambulance assignment, misallocation of hospitals, and improper routing. In India alone, over 168,000 road accident deaths were reported in 2022, with nearly 40% of critical patients losing their lives due to the lack of timely ambulance services. More than 50% of accident victims do not receive help within the golden hour, significantly reducing their chances of survival.
